This file explains the features (columns) used in the classification and regression models.

1. Pclass
   - Passenger Class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
   - Higher class (1) usually means more money paid and higher chance of survival.

2. Sex
   - Gender of the passenger.
   - 'male' is encoded as 1, 'female' as 0.

3. Age
   - Age of the passenger.
   - If missing, we replace it with the average age (around 29.7).

4. SibSp
   - Number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard.

5. Parch
